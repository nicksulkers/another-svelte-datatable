# Another Svelte Datatable

A svelte component to create slightly more useful tables, somewhat inspired by jQuery DataTables.

While I fully intend to give some meaningful information on how to use this component here, it may take me a while to actually document it.

For the time being please see the examples directory on the [github repository](https://github.com/nicksulkers/another-svelte-datatable) to get an idea of how to use the Svelte Datatable
